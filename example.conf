############################
# TLS Config
############################
# Path to the CA certificate. This is primarily used by gubernator
# when connecting to other gubernator peers.
# GUBER_TLS_CA=/path/to/ca.pem

# Path to the CA private key. See GUBER_TLS_AUTO for details
# GUBER_TLS_CA_KEY=/path/to/ca.key

# Path to the server certificate. Certificate used by the server/clients for TLS connections.
# GUBER_TLS_CERT=/path/to/server.pem

# Path to the server private key. This is the key for the certificate. Must be unencrypted.
# GUBER_TLS_KEY=/path/to/server.key

# If set to `true` gubernator will generate both the CA and self-signed server certificates.
# If GUBER_TLS_CA and GUBER_TLS_CA_KEY are set but no GUBER_TLS_KEY or GUBER_TLS_CERT is set
# then gubernator will generate a self-signed key using the provided GUBER_TLS_CA and
# GUBER_TLS_CA_KEY. This avoids the need to distribute a new server cert for each gubernator
# instance at the cost of distributing the CA private key. If set but no CA or TLS certs are
# provided gubernator will generate a CA and certs needed TLS.
# GUBER_TLS_AUTO=false

# Sets the Client Authentication type as defined in the golang standard 'crypto/tls' package.
# Valid types are ('request-cert', 'verify-cert', 'require-any-cert', 'require-and-verify').
# Use `require-and-verify` to achieve secure client authentication which will apply to all
# client and gubernator peer to peer communication. If set then gubernator will attempt to
# load GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH_CA_CERT, GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH_KEY and
# GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT for use with client authentication. If not provided client
# auth will use GUBER_TLS_CA, GUBER_TLS_CERT and GUBER_TLS_KEY for client authentication.
# GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH=require-and-verify

# For use with GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH
# GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH_KEY=/path/to/client.key
# GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT=/path/to/client.pem
# GUBER_TLS_CLIENT_AUTH_CA_CERT=/path/to/client-ca.pem

# If true, TLS peer to peer clients will accept any certificate presented by the remote
# gubernator instance and any host name in that certificate.
